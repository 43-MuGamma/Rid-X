Instructions TO RUN THE GAME...

1) Make sure you have the latest Unity engine (I used 5.3)

2) Open the project folder

3) Close all tabs (right click and "close tab") and make sure the 
"Game" tab is open

4) Press the play button to play! (Make sure you press stop and then play again for everytime the player dies or basically disappears off the screen and stops interacting with the scene graph)



What is the game about?

You are "Rid-X", an antibody within someone's bloodstream. The goal of the game is to fend off as many antigens (toxins) as possible. This game is educational in the sense that it demonstrates how the body's defense mechanism, that is antibodies or specific white blood cells, protect the body from illness.



What additional contributions can be made?

Hit me up if you are interested in further developing "Rid-X" as I feel it can have a lot of future potential with enough people dedicated to the project.



How was this game built?

Rid-X was originally built using the JmonkeyEngine3 but was ported over Unity due to technical development issues. I was the only person developing it at the time.
